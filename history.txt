  - Storage S3 bucket
  - SES verification token
  - DKIM tokens 

- Converted AWS CloudFormation template to Terraform:

  - Created templates/user_data.sh.tpl for instance initialization
  - Configured security group with required ports (25, 587, 993, 80, 443, 22)
  - Set up Mail-in-a-Box installation in user data script
  - Configured S3 backup and storage sync scripts

- Deployed infrastructure:
  - Created security group: sg-083e89e34b4c5a240
  - Launched EC2 instance: i-08ed9c5e38eb5abcd (recreated)
  - Associated Elastic IP: 3.210.30.70
  - Mail server domain: mail.qolimpact.click
  - Backup bucket: mail-backup-mail.qolimpact.click
  - Storage bucket: mail-storage-mail.qolimpact.click

- Fixed Mail-in-a-Box setup issues:
  - Added user-data user and directory creation
  - Fixed environment variables script
  - Added non-interactive mode
  - Added network checks skip
  - Fixed script execution with bash instead of ./
  - Recreated instance with fixed setup

- Fixed user data script issues:
  - Changed environment variables handling to use variables.env
  - Added error handling with set -ex
  - Fixed Mail-in-a-Box setup path
  - Added DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive for package installation
  - Made user creation more robust with || true

[2024-03-19 14:30] Instance recreated with fixed user data script
- Old instance i-08ed9c5e38eb5abcd terminated
- New instance i-0fc97ae74770fc08e created
- Elastic IP 3.210.30.70 reassociated
- Mail server domain remains mail.qolimpact.click 

[2024-03-21] Added environment variable to EC2 user_data template
- Added environment variable to templatefile call in ec2.tf
- This variable is used in the user_data.sh.tpl script to fetch SMTP credentials from SSM parameter store
- Parameters affected: /mail-server/${environment}/smtp-username and /mail-server/${environment}/smtp-password 

March 21, 2024 - Password Management Verification
- Verified the secure implementation of SMTP credentials in user_data.sh.tpl
- Confirmed credentials are retrieved from SSM Parameter Store with encryption
- Parameters used: /mail-server/${environment}/smtp-username and /mail-server/${environment}/smtp-password
- Local credential files (/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd) are properly secured with 0600 permissions
- No hardcoded credentials found in the template 

March 21, 2024 - Fixed SES MAIL FROM Domain Configuration
- Fixed error with SES MAIL FROM domain configuration
- Changed MAIL FROM domain to bounce.mail.qolimpact.click (subdomain of identity domain)
- Added required DNS records for MAIL FROM domain:
  - MX record pointing to feedback-smtp.${aws_region}.amazonses.com
  - SPF record with v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
- This change ensures proper bounce handling and email deliverability 

March 21, 2024 - Enhanced SES Configuration
- Added missing SES domain verification TXT record (_amazonses.mail.qolimpact.click)
- Enhanced SES Configuration Set with:
  - Enabled reputation metrics
  - Required TLS for delivery
  - Added CloudWatch event destination for tracking email events
- Identified SES sandbox limitations:
  - Limited to 200 emails per 24 hours
  - Can only send to verified email addresses
  - Both sender and recipient addresses must be verified
- Next steps:
  1. Request production access to move out of sandbox
  2. Verify sender email addresses
  3. Monitor email sending events in CloudWatch 

[2024-05-27] Fix SES MAIL FROM Domain Creation Error
- Added depends_on to aws_ses_domain_mail_from in ses.tf to ensure it waits for SES domain identity and verification TXT record.
- Note: The first terraform apply may still fail if SES domain is not yet verified. Wait for verification, then re-apply. 

[2024-05-27] Mail Server Port Test
- Created test_mail_ports.sh to check if ports 25, 587, and 993 are open on mail.qolimpact.click.
- Ran the script. Results:
  - Port 25: CLOSED
  - Port 587: CLOSED
  - Port 993: CLOSED
- Indicates the mail server is not accessible on these ports from the public internet. Next steps: check EC2 instance firewall, mail server software, and AWS security group settings. 

[2025-05-28] Created README-mailinabox-setup.md: concise instructions for setting up Mail-in-a-Box on a new instance, based on https://mailinabox.email/guide.html. Includes SSH, setup, admin access, DNS, TLS, and maintenance notes.
[2025-05-28] Added setup_postfix_ses_relay.sh: script to configure Postfix to relay mail through SES using credentials from SSM Parameter Store, following Mail-in-a-Box advanced configuration guide.
[2025-05-28] Updated README-mailinabox-setup.md: added concise instructions for setting up SMTP relay with SES and reference to the script and official documentation.
[2025-05-28] Modified setup_postfix_ses_relay.sh to run from local computer, retrieve SMTP credentials from SSM locally, and configure Postfix on remote Mail-in-a-Box server via SSH. Updated README-mailinabox-setup.md to reflect new workflow and SSH configuration steps.
